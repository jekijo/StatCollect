# StatCollect
These files were used to collect, store, and display all the data used in the NBAsite repo.
Using a webscraper created in Python and a SQL database, championship team stat averages were collected alongside the NBA league averages over the past twenty two years. These were then visualized using seaborn and placed on a React app in the repository titled NBAsite.
